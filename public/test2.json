      "overall": "Looking back at its production life, the first generation Citroen C1 city car seemed to have more refreshes, relaunches and re-releases than virtually any other model this side of a Bugatti Veyron, but don't worry too much about the details. At its heart, the C1 remains a fundamentally good design, with a willing 1.0-litre petrol engine, a space-efficient cabin, a respectable amount of safety kit and ultra-low running costs. If anything, it's even more appealing as a used purchase, especially if you can pick up a clean low mileage example of a later post-2012 car like those we've been looking at here,ideally one that's just been used to nip to the local shops. For younger drivers looking for a first runabout that's affordable but not a total snooze",
